        Building Progressive Web Apps with Ionic
      </h2>
      <p>
        Everything changed when Google created the concept of Progressive Web Applications or PWA. A PWA is a pure web application that you can install on devices, that can function with limited network functionality, through its  use of intelligent caching. Build a Progressive Web App that will run anywhere. In this course, Building Progressive Web Apps with Ionic, you will learn foundational knowledge and gain the ability to create a web application that will run anywhere: the browser, desktop, or mobile clients. First, you will learn what a Progressive Web App (or PWA) is. Next, you will discover how to use the Ionic Framework, Angular, and Firebase to create, deploy, and optimize a basic web application into a full-blown PWA. Finally, you will explore how to configure the application to make it installable and runnable on Androids and iPhones. When you’re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of Ionic and PWAs needed to create and deploy your own Progressive Web Application anywhere you desire.</p>
