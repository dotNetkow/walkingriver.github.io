# About Walking River
Walking River is my online alias, encompassing everything I do outside of my day job. 

## What is a Walking River?
Many years ago my wife and I were exploring the mountain of northern New Hampshire. We parked along the side of the Swift River, just off the Kancamagus Highway, near a gorgeous covered bridge. As we made our way down to the riverbank, my wife exclaimed that it was a "walking river." Upon seeing my puzzled expression, she explained that a walking river is any river or stream that is so full of rocks, that one can easily walk across or along it without getting wet. You simply walk or hop from rock to rock.

When I got home from that trip, I registered walkingriver.com, and have been using the name informally for years. It is my online persona for most of my personal projects.
