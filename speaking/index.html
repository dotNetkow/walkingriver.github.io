<h1>Speaking Availability</h1>
<div class="courses">
  <div class="hero devdays">
  </div>
  <p>
    In addition to being a software developer, mentor, and Pluralsight author, I am also available to do technical talks
    and workshops on software development for your company, user group, or technical conference. If you would like me to
    appear at your event, please contact me via <a href="/contact">my contact page</a>.

    If you would like me to speak at your event, I have a few simple requests, depending on the type of the event.</p>

  <h2>Corporate Training</h2>
  <p>
    If you would like me to speak at your company about software development, web or mobile development, then please get
    in touch with me to discuss the options. For corporate talks, there will be a speaker fee that we will need to agree
    ahead of time and travel costs, as well as accommodation costs, if your company is more than 2 hours by car from the
    Orlando, Florida area.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want me to speak in the morning, then I will require travelling the night before and staying in a hotel.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Commercial Conferences
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you run a commercial conference that charges its attendees to attend, then I have some specific requirements. I
    do not expect to be paid to speak at your event, but I donâ€™t expect to be out of pocket to do so. Therefore I expect
    my full travel and accommodation expenses to be booked and paid in advance of the event. For all conferences, I
    would expect a pass to the entire event, and I will make sure I am present to network and talk to attendees during
    the event.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are welcome to produce video recordings of my talks and then make them available to the conference, with no additional conditions on my part. Please let me know ahead of time if you plan to record the talk.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the conference is within Florida and more than a 2 or 3-hour drive, I will require an airline ticket and hotel. I
    would want to arrive the night before the event and either return the evening of the event or the next morning which
    will be arranged ahead of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the conference is inside of the United States and is less than a 4-hour flight, then I would need to be flown in
    the day before the conference and return the day after the conference. I am happy to fly economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the conference is inside the United States but longer than a 4-hour flight, then I would want to be flown in 2
    days early to adjust to local time zones and leave the day after the conference finishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    My talks are normally written and produced in advance of the event. Therefore I will not adapt my talks to fit
    with your slide templates. I am happy to put your conference logo on the slides or have a branded first slide to
    display before the talk starts.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Community Events (User Groups and Conferences)
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you run a community event that does not charge its attendees and you would like me to speak at your event, then
    please do get in touch to see what we can arrange. Because speaking at community events requires me typically
    to fund the travel and accommodation myself, I have to limit the amount I do, but I will try to accommodate
    community events as best I can as they are critical to helping people learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your event has sponsorship and you are in a position to assist with travel and hotels, then this
    will significantly increase the chance of me being able to come to your event.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, please <a href="/contact">get in touch with me</a>, and we will see what we can arrange. 
    Community events are crucial to local communities to help promote shared learning and networking.
