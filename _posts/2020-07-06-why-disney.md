I am currently in my tenth year as a Disney Technology Cast Member. As the tenth year is a milestone year at the company, I have spent some time reflecting on my time here, my career, and where I want to go over the next decade. My conclusion is that I cannot imagine working anywhere else. This post describes some of my reasons why.

<!--more-->

# Background

Technically, I do not work for Walt Disney World, though that is the easiest way to explain it to people. In fact, I am employed by Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products Technology and Digital. That is much harder to say, so I tell people I work at Walt Disney World, which is close enough.

# Non-Career Benefits

What do I mean by non-career benefits? Simply, these are advantages and perks of working for Disney that have absolutely nothing to do with your day-to-day job activities. The are simply extras and there are a lot of them.

In fact, it is hard to decide where to begin. Often it seems that there are more of these types of benefits than is possible to enjoy in any given year. At one point, I participated in so many that my children asked me at dinner one night, "What do you do at Disney again?"

I will describe some of my personal favorite non-career benefits below. By no means is this en exhaustive list.

## Park Admission
One of the first questions I get when someone hears where I work is whether I get free park admission. The answer to that is "mostly." Every Disney Cast Member gets a pass permitting nearly unlimited self-access to most of the Disney theme parks throughout the world. I say "nearly unlimited" because the passes are subject to being "blocked out" during certain peak periods. For all intents and purposes, the Cast Member can get into just about any park on almost any day of the year.

Additionally, most Cast Members receive Guest Passes that they can use to admit guests, such as friends and family members. The use of these passes is regulated, and the number of uses per year depends on the Cast Member's job and/or years of service.

## Cross-U

About twice per year, usually around the Christmas and Easter holidays, the Walt Disney World theme park leadership will send out a call for volunteers to be "Cross Utilized" in a role other than their primary one. This is known as a Cross-U. We are encouraged to volunteer to sign up for a shift inside a theme park to help with the additional work that comes a higher crowd level. 

I look forward to signing up every year because I never know who I will meet or what kinds of jobs I will do. Here are a few of them:

- Making and serving popcorn in Magic Kingdom and Disney's Hollywood Studios
- Pouring sodas at Casey's Corner in Magic Kingdom
- Picking up trash throughout Disney's Animal Kingdom Park and Magic Kingdom
- Parking strollers at Kilimanjaro Safari
- Crowd control outside of It's a Small World
- Clearing tables at Tusker House and Restaurantasaurus
- Menu distribution at the Electric Umbrella in Epcot
- Seating and menu assistance at Be Our Guest restaurant in Magic Kingdom

## Media Events
Before any major opening, the company will invite a group of local, national, and sometimes global media to experience the attraction, resort, or land ahead of time. During such events, volunteers are need to assist with such a large undertaking. The work required typically revolves around helping members of the press get from their resorts to their interviews and other activities on time. I have enjoyed the opportunity to be involved with many such events, and look forward to them when they occur. 

I have had the good fortune of working with print, radio, and television media from nearby markets like Orlando and Tampa, and as far away as England and The Netherlands.

During the dedication event for Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney's Hollywood Studios, I was helping the station's cameraman with his tripod and got stuck behind him as the event started. I kept out of the way, but did manage to get some decent pictures of the event.

### Goofy's Mystery Tour

# Career Benefits

Of course, working at Disney is more than fun and games. There are many career benefits available to everyone at all levels of the operation.

## Work-Life Balance
Most companies go out of their way to say how important work-life balance it. I have never worked for a company as committed to the reality as Disney. 

I was on a call with our Vice President recently and the subject came up that many people were accruing too much vacation time. At the time of this writing, we are still dealing with COVID-19. With everything there is to do, it seems that few people want to take time off. We asked what should be done about it. The answer was simple: Take your vacation. The work will still be here when you get back.

In my nearly ten years here, no one has ever been asked to sacrifice home or family life for work. 

## Interesting Project Potential

With so much happening, the potential for working on interesting projects is practically unlimited. I have personally been involved with projects of the following nature:

- Cast-facing resort and dining reservations systems.
- Reservations and Guest systems for Disney Vacation Club.
- New transportation hardware and software systems.
- Mobile device project for Disney's Magical Express.
- Sales systems for travel agents.
- Resort Motorcoach arrival time signage.

There is enough going on at any given time that there is usually some way

## Unparalleled Growth Opportunities

You may have heard of [George Kalogridis](https://dpep.disney.com/leaders/george-kalogridis/), who recently stepped down as president of the Walt Disney World Resort. From his bio page just referenced...

>In September of 1971, at age 17, George began his Disney Parks career as a busboy at Disneyâ€™s Contemporary Resort, helping to open Walt Disney World.

George's career had a humble beginning, yet he climbed the ladder to become the president of the entire resort. Few other companies can compare to this type of growth potential.

Lest you think this is some kind of fluke, let me tell you about one of my first coworkers. He began with Disney more than 25 years ago as a Cast Member in Housekeeping, making beds. Because he could type and was familiar with Microsoft Excel, his manager recruited him to help set up a shift scheduling spreadsheet. This led to an appreciation for software. He took some classes and learned software development. Today he is a Lead Solutions Architect with the company.

## Approachable Leadership

There are plenty of stories of Walt himself walking through Disneyland Park, greeting Guests and Cast Members. One story describes Walt meeting a custodial Cast Member in Town Square, who proceeded to refer to him as "Mr. Disney." Walt immediately corrected the young man. "Walt, son. Call me Walt." More than 60 years later that attitude continues. Every Cast Member is free to call another by his/her first name, regardless of the relative differences in their roles. We all even wear name tags displaying our first names and home towns, from the newest College Program participant just "earning my ears" to the CEO.

Most executives in the organization are extremely approachable and friendly. I have never felt any discomfort in sticking my head in an open door and asking our Director or Vice President, "do you have a few moments?" Usually the answer is yes. If not, a quick email will always be returned. 

I just double checked and there are exactly seven people between me and the CEO of The Walt Disney Company. That may seem like a lot at first glance, but I can say with confidence that six of them know me personally, and I have met privately with each of them at least once. At one time I could claim having met with all seven, but Meg Crofton retired a few years ago and I have not met any of her replacements.

## College Internships
Disney has one of the greatest internship programs I have ever seen. 

## Training Opportunities


## Disney Aspire

# Are There Downsides?

# Bottom Line

I have worked for many companies, large and small, over the past three decades. Each has offered at least one of these types of benefits. None, however, has come close to the total experience of being a technology Cast Member at Walt Disney World. 

If I have inspired you to considering joining this amazing organization, I will direct you to the following resources. As I am writing this, we are right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, and hiring is probably not a huge priority. That will not last forever, though. 

If you think you have the skills and talents to join us, we will eventually have more technology jobs open.
