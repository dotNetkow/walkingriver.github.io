I hate shaving. It is one of life's cruel twists in that I have to shave daily, but cannot grow a beard to save my life. Thus, I am stuck with the worst of all possible options in this regard. For most of my adult life, I have used Gillette products for my daily routine of pain. And I do not mean simply physical pain. Gillette products are not inexpensive. Recently, I thought I might give the lower-cost upstarts a try: Dollar Shave Club and Harry's. They each offer an inexpensive starter kit, so I decided to experiment with each of them for a month and see how it goes.

# Complete Review 
The table above lists the summary of my results. This section contains a more thorough review. This should present enough information for you to reproduce the experiment if you wish; alternatively, it may provide you with information to draw your own conclusions from mine.  

## The Products Being Tested
### Dollar Shave Club Starter Set
I began by ordering the $5 [The Ultimate Shave Starter Set](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/get-started/plan/ultimate-shave-starter-set), which includes the following products:

- Razor Cartridges (4 pk)
- Executive Handle (1 ct)
- Shave Butter Trial Size (1 oz)
- Prep Scrub Trial (1 oz)
- Post Shave Dew Trial Size (1 oz)

### Gillette Fusion Pro Shield
This is my go-to blade, the [Fusion Pro Shield](https://amzn.to/2l9mvXA). I have been using it for years, essentially since it was released.

### Gillette Fusion Proglide Shave Gel
I have been using the [Fusion Proglide Shave Gel](https://amzn.to/2l7x6Cl) for longer than I can remember. It goes on as a blue gel and lubricates well. I find when I use this shave gel, I get a better shave with much less irritation than otherwise.

### PURE by Gillette Shaving Cream for Men
I stumbled upon a can of [PURE Shaving Cream](https://amzn.to/2XUUm9b) recently and decided to add it to my overall test. It appears to be similar the Proglide gel, without the color or scent.

### Target Up & Up Shave Gel
Part of my test inadvertently used a shave gel I'd never used before. At the end of my first week, I ran out of my normal shave gel and ended up with a [Target Brand](https://www.target.com/p/therapeutic-shave-gel-with-colloidal-oatmeal-and-vitamin-e-7oz-up-up-153-compare-to-aveeno-active-naturals-therapeutic-shave-gel/-/A-13970853). As you will see, I worked it in, but the results were unsatisfactory.

### Gillette Aftershave
Aftershave seems to be getting harder to find. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but my basic go-to is this [Gillette Aftershave Gel](https://amzn.to/2YanLrc). It has a pleasant scent, is easy to apply, and a little goes a long way. I can get months out of a single 2.5 oz bottle.

# The Experiment
The Dollar Shave Club starter set came with four blades. The box in which the blades were packaged said the for best results, use one blade per week. At that rate, not only would I not be saving any money over the Gillette, it would end up costing me more. I shave daily, and can get a month out of a Gillette Proshield blade cartridge. Somewhere during the third week, however, the quality of the shave begins to deteriorate. Given that fact, I decided to try each blade for two weeks, without changing any other variable. 

## Day 1
I began my experiment on July 1, 2019, and it lasted exactly one day. My initial plan was to use everything included in the DSC starter kit. That was a mistake.
