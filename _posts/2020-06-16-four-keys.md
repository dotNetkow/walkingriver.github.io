I recently celebrated nine years as a [software developer at Walt Disney World in Florida](https://walkingriver.com/magical-job). It is the longest I have ever stayed with a single company in my nearly 30-year software development career. Not coincidentally, it has also been one of my most rewarding. In this post I will describe a philosophy of Guest Service known as Walt Disney's Four Keys Basics. In a follow-up, I will discuss how to apply these basics to software development.

# A Brief Note

In case you are wondering, none of this is secret or confidential information. The company has made much of this information public. If you are interested in learning more about Walt's theories of Guest relations, take a look at [Be Our Guest](https://www.amazon.com/Be-Our-Guest-Perfecting-Institute/dp/1423145844/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=walkingriver-20&linkId=234946f84949a42451f1cd3973527d73&language=en_US), a book by The Disney Institute.

# Walt's Four Keys Basics 

![Four Keys Basics](/assets/img/four-keys.png)

Soon after being hired at Walt Disney World (and I presume other Disney Parks), each new "Cast Member" is sent to a class known as "Traditions," a half- or all-day course introducing the attendee to the basics of Guest Service, company history and culture, and a few surprises. It does not matter if the individual is a new executive or a College Program participant, everyone takes Traditions. 

I attended Traditions on May 10, 2011, and it was where I first learned about "Walt Disney's Four Keys Basics." Briefly, the four keys are as follows:

- Safety
- Courtesy
- Show
- Efficiency

The order they are presented is important, as each one supersedes the ones that come after. In other words, safety is the most important key. Below are some 

## Safety
> I practice safe behaviors in everything I do.

Guest and Cast safety come before everything else. 

![Illuminations at Epcot](/assets/img/illuminations.jpg)

To illustrate, I was at Epcot with my family one night. We were waiting for the start of Illuminations: Reflections of Earth. If you have never seen it, Illuminations featured fireworks, fire, water, and lasers, all set to a powerful symphonic score. The show was presented primarily in the center of World Showcase Lagoon, which means it is visible all around Epcot's World Showcase. Unlike most fireworks shows, much of the show took place low to the water. This meant that the "best" viewing spots were right against the railing. Sometimes there were Guests who decided that the railing was not quite close enough.

On this particular night, a young couple decided they needed to cross the railing and get closer. I think they simply wanted to get a cool picture of themselves in front of the lagoon. What they apparently did not know was that Illuminations featured perimeter fireworks, and one of the launch tubes was very close to where they decided to stand. Before I could get their attention and warn them, some Epcot security personnel appeared seemingly out of nowhere to get them out of harm's way. 

I have seen similar concerns for safety with around broken glass, spilled food, and other "accidents." I have never witnessed a Cast Member put safety aside for any reason.

Safety is not limited to physical dangers, either. A few years ago a number of Technology Cast were asked to inspect and secure every credit card terminal throughout the entire resort. We were provided with anti-tampering stickers and a checklist of things to investigate. Teams of two or three were assigned to a specific area and dispatched prior to opening. My team was assigned to Frontierland at Magic Kingdom. At one point, there were only three of us on Tom Sawyer Island, which was pretty cool.

## Courtesy
> I go above and beyond to exceed Guest expectations.

The next most important key is Courtesy. As long as safety is not compromised, Disney Cast Members will do everything in their power to make every Guest feel like a VIP. This is not an abstract concept. You may have heard of the "Disney point." Cast Members are taught that pointing with the index finger is considered rude in some cultures. Rather than worrying about who might be offended, we are instructed to point with two fingers or all five. 

Cast are taught to speak to children at their level. You will often see Cast Members crouching down to speak to children eye to eye. They often refer to child Guests as "prince" or "princess." 

If you are visiting as a Guest and are wearing a button displaying a birthday, anniversary, wedding, or other celebration, most Cast Members will go out of their way to comment on it and congratulate you.

Courtesy extends to more than this, however. Disney Cast are empowered to help make things right when things go wrong. This empowerment goes beyond the Cast Members you encounter in the Parks. 

![Disney's Boardwalk Resort](/assets/img/boardwalk.jpg)

One night I was at Disney's Boardwalk Resort, waiting to meet another Cast Member for dinner. While standing on the boardwalk, overlooking Crescent Lake, I suddenly heard what was clearly an exclamation of frustration. Turning to look, I saw a young family who had just left the ice cream parlor. One of the children had dropped his ice cream cone and was on the verge of tears. I am not an operations Cast Member, but I too am empowered to help wherever I can. I went over to them and introduced myself to the mother, and offered to help them replace the ice cream. I went into the ice cream parlor, explained the situation, and got a replacement. As I returned to the family, the mother thanked me profusely and then proceeded to tell me how that little action had made their day. 

Other examples of courtesy can be seen anytime a Guest receives a "Magical Moment." These are usually minor surprises, and I love being part of them. I have seen Guests surprised with free snacks, Fast Passes, fireworks viewing upgrades, and more. One of my favorites is the "Parade Marshall" family, selected from the day's park Guests to ride in the front vehicle of the daily parade. If you have ever been the recipient of a Magical Moment, you know how special they can be.

## Show 
> I ensure my area is show-ready at all times.

"Show-ready" implies that the parks, resorts, attractions, restaurants, and everything else are always ready for Guests to experience and enjoy. Appearances, decorations, and theming should be internally consistent. Everything should be clean and free of distractions.

Cast Members can ensure that an attraction is show-ready by keeping their areas free of distracting clutter. They will immediately report any maintenance issues, and take action to correct issues where appropriate. 

Every Cast Member is expected to help keep the parks and resorts clean, even when they are not on the clock. If I am visiting a park and see some rogue trash, I will (safely) dispose of it. If I cannot do so safely, I will find another Cast Member who is working, who can summon the appropriate custodial personnel. 

You may have heard the story of Walt Disney seeing a cowboy walking through Tommorrowland in Disneyland Park on his way to Frontierland. That jarring juxtaposition is an example not being show-ready. It made such an impact on Walt that he insisted that Disney World in Florida be designed in such a way as to make that type of situation far less likely. The result was [the Utilidor (via Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_utilidor_system#cite_note-1). 

## Efficiency
> I perform my role efficiently so Guests get the most out of their visit.

Disney Parks are always looking for ways to make the Guest experience more efficient. This has led to such innovations as FastPass+, Mobile Ordering at Quick Serve Restaurants, Memory Maker Photos, Magic Bands for park and resort entrance, and more.

If you have experienced the virtual "boarding parties" for Rise of the Resistance in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, you have seen one of the most recent examples of Efficiency first-hand. 

# Applying the Four Keys to Software Development
This post is being presented in two parts. In Part 2 I will describe how I apply these same principles to my software development projects, and how you can, too.

Look for the next part in a week or so at [walkingriver.com](https://walkingriver.com).

# Want to See More?
Would you like to see more content like this? At the urging of some of my more vocal fans, I am considering writing a book on business communications, taken from my nearly three decades as a software developer. I have made and overcome a lot of mistakes, and am eager to share them with you. You may have seen some of this content before, specifically my blogs posts on [spelling and grammar](https://walkingriver.com/watch-your-language/) and my recently shared experience on [almost committing perjury](https://walkingriver.com/perjury). 

Here is my proposal. If I can get at least 25 people willing to preorder such a book, then I will write it. For more information, please see my [Gumroad Page here](https://gumroad.com/walkingriver).
