<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id692412579?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://cdnvideo.dolimg.com/cdn_assets/6c9e4439c26ac88de3249533c618ad20fcaf9a5a.jpg" height="200" width="200" /></a></div><br /><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?--> <span style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">It's happened to all of us. You are about to get a branch new smartphone, when it hits you. You're on level 250 of <a href="http://games.disney.com/frozen-free-fall-app" target="_blank">Frozen Free Fall</a></span><span style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">. If you get a new phone, you'll lose all of that progress! Ok, admittedly this isn't the most pressing problem of our time, but it's annoying. So today I decided to do something about it.</span><br /><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 (Android), and just received an iPhone 5c. Before you bash me on my phone choice, let me explain that the iPhone is provided by my employer at no cost to me. Now you may proceed to bash me for putting games on my work phone.&nbsp; </div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">First step: Frozen Free Fall had already been installed on both devices. Next, using the Astro File Manager on my Galaxy, I searched and found the Frozen game save stored in /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/com.disney.frozensaga_goo/files/user.dat. I imagine it will be in the same location on any Android phone. If not, just look for user.dat in a folder with a similar name. So, using a USB cable and the Android File Transfer application, I copied this file to my desktop. Feel free to use any method you are comfortable with to copy the file to your desktop. </div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">On my desktop, I installed a program called <a href="http://i-funbox.com/" target="_blank">iFunBox</a> (available for Windows or Mac). This application enabled me browse the iPhone's file system. I found a folder on the phone at iPhone:User Applications:Free Fall that also contained a user.dat file. Being the careful soul that I am, I renamed user.dat to user.dat.old, just in case my idea failed, and then used iFunBox to copy the file I got from the Galaxy into the same folder. </div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">Once I launched Frozen Free Fall on the iPhone, the game instantly showed me my current progress. Now I won't have to start the game all over again. Nor will I have to carry both phones. </div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Arial; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;">Hopefully this information will help others. However, proceed at your own risk. If you aren't comfortable messing with your phone's filesystem, please don't attempt this. Also, these are the only two phones I have. Please don't ask me for help doing this on other platforms. Good luck.&nbsp;</div>
