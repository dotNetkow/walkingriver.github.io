It seems that every time I start a new ASP.NET WebAPI project, I have to go out to the web to "remember" what I want in my OWIN Startup class. Not anymore. I added a <a href="https://gist.github.com/walkingriver/f9260b04a3b5029f9915" target="_blank">GitHub Gist</a> that I can copy (and add to) whenever I start a new project.<br /><br />There should never be anything in that file that is proprietary, so I figured I'd open it up to the world, for comments, edits, etc.<br /><br />What's in it so far:<br /><br /><ul><li>Attribute Routing</li><li>Error Details</li><li>JSON as the default in the browser</li><li>Using camelCase with the default JSON serializer.</li><li>Comments to remind me which NuGet packages to install to make it all work.</li></ul><div>Feel free to comment, fork, issue pull requests, etc. I'd like this to grow over time to become useful for anyone creating a new WebAPI application.</div><div><br /></div>
