<h1>New Courses!</h1>
<p>I have announced two new Ionic Framework courses, which are currently in progress. They are being offered at a reduced rate for a limited time. You can learn more or enroll at <a href="https://coursecraft.net/users/cREs">CourseCraft.net</a>.</p>

<p>
  I also author <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/OnWrP">courses for Pluralsight</a>, almost exclusively about the
  Ionic Framework.

<h1>Test Yourself</h1>
<p>
  Do you think you know Ionic? Now you can prove it. I created two tests for 
  <a href="https://kand.io/tests">kandâ€¢io</a>. You can choose either <a href="https://kand.io/tests/details/ionic-react/">Ionic-React</a> or <a href="https://kand.io/tests/details/ionic-angular/">Ionic-Angular</a>, enabling you to show off your Ionic expertise.
